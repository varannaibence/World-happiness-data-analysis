# World Happiness Data Analysis (2015–2020)

An exploration of how **happiness, corruption, GDP, and health** connect across continents between 2015 and 2020.  
This project focuses on the **core stages of data work** cleaning, analysis, and visualization forming a foundation for deeper AI-driven insights later on.

## Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Understand how **economic performance**, **corruption (CPI)**, and **health** influence global happiness levels, and translate these insights into structured data for future machine learning work.

**Dataset:**  
[World Happiness & Corruption Index *(2015–2020)*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eliasturk/world-happiness-based-on-cpi-20152020)

**Tools & Libraries:**  
`Python` · `pandas` · `NumPy` · `Seaborn` · `Matplotlib`

**Focus Areas:**  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature selection and cleaning  
- Correlation-based reasoning  
- Visual storytelling with structured data

## Visual Insights

### GDP Efficiency vs Corruption (2020 Snapshot)

</p>

Each point represents a country.  
Higher CPI → *less corruption*.  
Countries with **lower corruption** generally achieve **higher GDP efficiency per happiness unit**,  
though the pattern becomes less stable in developing regions.

</p>

**Key Takeaways:**  
- **Happiness** correlates strongly with **GDP per capita** and **health**.  
- **Corruption (CPI)** remains a key indicator of governance and quality of life.  
- **Developed regions** show tighter alignment between economics and well-being than developing ones.

## Analytical Insights

| Observation | Insight |
|--------------|----------|
| **Wealth ≠ Happiness** | Economic strength supports happiness, but health and stability matter just as much. |
| **CPI as a mirror of governance** | Lower corruption aligns with better efficiency and higher life satisfaction. |
| **Regional gaps** | Europe and North America maintain consistent balance; Africa and Asia remain more variable. |
